Selenium
Library Type: Selenium is a web browser automation library.
API Level: Low-level API, requiring more code to handle common tasks.
Simplicity: Less user-friendly; requires boilerplate code for setup and handling common scenarios.
Fluent Interface: Does not provide a fluent interface out-of-the-box.
Wait Mechanism: Requires explicit waits to handle dynamic content (e.g., WebDriverWait).
Reporting: No built-in reporting capabilities; requires third-party libraries.
Community and Support: Large and active community, widely adopted across various industries.
Flexibility: Highly flexible and customizable; supports multiple languages (Java, Python, C#, etc.).
Integration: Easily integrates with other testing frameworks and tools.

Selenide
Library Type: Selenide is a wrapper around Selenium, designed to simplify browser automation.
API Level: High-level API, providing concise and readable code.
Simplicity: More user-friendly; reduces boilerplate code with built-in solutions for common tasks.
Fluent Interface: Provides a fluent interface for easier and more readable tests.
Wait Mechanism: Has built-in automatic waits, simplifying handling of dynamic content.
Reporting: Includes built-in reporting capabilities (e.g., screenshots on failure).
Community and Support: Growing community, but smaller than Selenium's.
Flexibility: Slightly less flexible than Selenium but covers most common use cases. Primarily supports Java.
Integration: Integrates well with popular testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG.

Key Differences in Code
Simplicity and Readability: Selenide code is more concise and readable, with built-in waits and less boilerplate.
Wait Mechanism: Selenide automatically handles waits, whereas Selenium requires explicit wait conditions.
Fluent Interface: Selenide provides a fluent interface, making the code more readable and easier to understand.

In summary, Selenium offers greater flexibility and is widely used, but requires more boilerplate
and explicit handling of common tasks. Selenide, on the other hand, simplifies the automation process
with a higher-level API, built-in waits, and a fluent interface, at the cost of some flexibility.
