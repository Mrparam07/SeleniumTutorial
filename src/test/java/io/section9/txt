Wait
Synchronization

To achieve synchronization

Implicit wait
wait time globally, wait for n sec before throw exception...max time limit is 5 sec
if the element is found it then before n sec it come out, won't wait for n sec then
wait till element to displayed within the timeframe, come out if it is found
disadvantage
say suppose max 5 sec required for 100 tc, and 15 sec for 100 tc
won't able to find the bug if we set 15 sec for all the tc
advantage
readable code
optimized

Explicit wait
not applied globally
for specific locator, exceptional cases only affect the specific locator

Qs - which wait in selenium is ideal to achieve synchronization?
Ans - combined use of both

Thread.sleep
part of java not selenium, used to wait for n sec, not dependent upon the locator

Fluent wait
